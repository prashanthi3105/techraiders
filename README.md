Absolutely, Prashanthi! For someone with your seniority and depth in Java full stack development, it’s important to touch on system design and architectural contributions, especially when talking to a Head of Technology like Salil.

Here’s your revised conversational version with a natural flow and a point about system/architecture design added in the right place:

Hi Salil, good morning! I’m Prashanthi. I have around 16 and a half years of experience, primarily into Java and J2EE technologies.

I started off my career as a core Java developer, and over the years I gradually picked up skills on both the database side and frontend technologies—so I eventually moved into a full stack developer role.

My first organization was Tanla Solutions, which was into mobile-based communications. After that, I worked with 4Soft on a logistics platform called Shipper Logistics.

Then I moved to Wells Fargo and spent almost 12 years there in the banking domain. I’ve been part of several large-scale, business-critical projects involving complex backend integrations, microservices, cloud migration, and performance tuning. I’ve been deeply involved in end-to-end system design—right from identifying key components, defining service boundaries, designing RESTful APIs, data modeling, to handling caching, scalability, and security concerns.

I’ve participated in solution architecture discussions quite regularly, especially where we had to deal with multi-system orchestration or high-volume transaction processing. For example, one of the systems I worked on handled real-time credit risk calculations, and we had to ensure both high availability and low latency, which made the design aspect very critical.

Around 6 years into my career, I started leading teams, mentoring developers, and driving technical decisions. I was quite active in internal innovation forums too—participated in hackathons like Probathon and Datathon, and submitted a few white papers. One of my papers made it into the top 50 list across the organization.

I also stood second in one of the hackathons, and that sparked my deeper interest in AI/ML. I pursued an 11-month certification in Machine Learning from IIIT-Hyderabad, which I completed in 2023. We did real-time projects there—mine was around predicting Gross National Income using ML models.

Even before that, around 5 years ago, I built some chatbot applications using IBM Watson and worked with NLP. So, I’ve always had an eye on new technologies and how we can bring them into enterprise use cases.

So yeah, that’s a bit about me and my journey so far!

Let me know if you’d like to add a recent project from Swiss Re as well or tailor this for a more AI-specific discussion.
