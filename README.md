Subject: Authorization Request for Unclaimed Property Claim – [Your Claim Reference Number]

Dear [Unclaimed Property Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I recently submitted a claim request through [MissingMoney.com] to recover my unclaimed RSR shares, which have been transferred to the State of Delaware due to inactivity.

To proceed further, I understand that an authorization email must be sent from my authorized email address. However, my authorized email is associated with my Wells Fargo account. As the rightful owner of the shares, I am reaching out to confirm my identity and provide the necessary authorization to process my claim.

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on the standard process for reclaiming unclaimed property, if one is already defined. This information would be extremely helpful in ensuring a smooth resolution.

Please let me know the next steps required from my end to successfully complete this process. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Prashanthi [Your Last Name]
[Your Contact Information]
