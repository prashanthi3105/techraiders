Subject: Authorization Request for Unclaimed Property Claim – [Your Claim Reference Number]

Dear [Unclaimed Property Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I recently submitted a claim request through [MissingMoney.com] to recover my unclaimed RSR shares, which have been transferred to the State of Delaware due to inactivity.

To proceed further, I understand that an authorization email must be sent from my authorized email address. However, my authorized email is associated with my Wells Fargo account. As the rightful owner of the shares, I am reaching out to confirm my identity and provide the necessary authorization to process my claim.

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on the standard process for reclaiming unclaimed property, if one is already defined. This information would be extremely helpful in ensuring a smooth resolution.

Please let me know the next steps required from my end to successfully complete this process. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Got it! Here’s a well-structured email for your Wells Fargo HR team:

Subject: Request for Authorization to Proceed with Unclaimed Property Claim

Dear [HR Team/Specific HR Contact],

I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out regarding an issue with unclaimed RSR shares that I originally received in March 2018 while at Wells Fargo. Due to inactivity, these shares were transferred to the unclaimed property division of the State of Delaware.

To recover these shares, I have already submitted a claim request through [MissingMoney.com]. However, in order to proceed further, the unclaimed property team requires an authorization email from my registered Wells Fargo email address to confirm my identity. Since my authorized email is associated with Wells Fargo, I am requesting your assistance in facilitating this process.

Could you please advise on how I can proceed with sending the required authorization? Additionally, if there is a defined process for retrieving unclaimed property in such cases, I would appreciate any guidance or documentation you can provide.

Your support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know the next steps or if any additional information is required.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
